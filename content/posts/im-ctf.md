## What Is a CTF?

A Capture The Flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges related to hacking, cryptography, reverse engineering, and more.

## My Experience at I&M CTF

This was my first time attending a CTF, and I wasn’t sure what to expect. The event was hosted by I&M and featured challenges ranging from basic Linux commands to web exploitation.

### Challenges I Solved

- **Basic Recon**: Used `whois`, `nslookup`, and `nmap` to gather info.
- **Steganography**: Found hidden flags in image metadata.
- **Web Exploitation**: Discovered a login bypass using SQL injection.

### What I Learned

- Teamwork matters — even in solo challenges, sharing ideas helps.
- Time management is key. I spent too long on one challenge and missed easier ones.
- I need to improve my reverse engineering skills.

### Final Thoughts

CTFs are a great way to learn by doing. I’m already looking forward to the next one!
